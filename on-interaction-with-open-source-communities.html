</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>During our regular meeting my colleague said he learned a lot during a
trip to one of our vendors, much more than he had expected. One of the
many eye opening learnings is that it is actually quite intimidating
to interact with open source communities.</p>
<p>It is true that it is not an easy task to work in the public. Sending
emails to a public mailing list is just like public speaking. Even if
I know whatever I say is not going to be used against me in any way, I
have the mental burden that if I make stupid mistakes it's going to be
on public record forever.</p>
<p>I'm lucky to have time to grow extra thick skin over a long period of
time. I started with small changes and gradually took on larger part
of the project. I also learned how to effectively to not take
criticisms personal and how to focus on the work itself.</p>
<p>Others might not be so lucky. Imagine I'm hired by some vendor and
assigned to contribute a big feature as my first take on the
project. Surely there will be mistakes and will be picked up by
maintainers and reviewers. If the maintainers are terse and straight,
it's natural that I feel hostility towards me. The more interations I
have, the more frustrated I feel. Eventually I just give up and move
on to other things.</p>
<p>It's a pity that the openess of a project actually works against
itself. No matter how nice one wants to be, there will be embarassing
moments.</p>
<p>There is no easy solution. The negative emotional effect is hard to
avoid. Some take it well, others don't. It takes time to educate
people. It takes time for people to change mentality. I am not too
optimistic on this issue getting sovlved any time soon.</p>
