			<h1>Free Software is not Free</h1>
			<p>There has been some back and forth discussion on how Xen's security process
sucks. Well, not quite. Though the email was titled that way, the content
didn't have much to do with security process per se. True, there are
technically correct points in that thread (with which I completely agree), but
the underlying theme is disturbing. That thread prompted me into thinking how
open source project functions. What I'm going to dwell on is not Xen project
specific.</p>
<p>All in all, there are people that don't want to invest time and money into an
open source project but want undue influence. The cold hard fact is that things
just don't work that way. Making a piece of software requires a lot of work.
Whatever great idea floating around needs to be implemented by an actual person
-- that comes down to time and money.</p>
<p>So while open source projects are often branded as "free" (as in either free
speech or free beer), the work behind them is not.  Open source world nowadays
function differently than 20 years ago. It has developed into a business model
that every major project has some vested interest of some companies. Their
employees act in the interest of the employers and prioritise work items
accordingly. There are hobbyists working on a project but it's hard for them to
make substantive contributions.</p>
<p>People have expectation that, since open source project is "free", they are
entitled to add more work items even if they don't want to invest time and
money. This is fundamentally wrong. Well, they are "free" to voice their
opinions, but then developers are "free" to ignore part of or all of those
opinions. The door is always open for collaborations though -- everybody is
"free" to join.</p>
<p>In a proprietary software world, there is normally no public channel to ask for
changes. But I'm pretty sure it all comes down to support contract or whatnot.
I can't imagine someone out of the blue goes to Microsoft and says "the way you
work is wrong, your priority is wrong, let me tell you what to do, but I don't
want to pay you anything".</p>
<p>And I have to admit I sometimes feel upset for such attitude and entitlement.
The joy of working on open source project is ruined. Not respecting the effort
other people put into the project is just demotivating. And I'm not only
talking about myself or Xen project specifically. There have been several
instances of developer burnout. Many people also wrote essays on similar
subjects.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, free software projects are just not "free" as some people
would like them to be. Ultimately, a free software project is what the whole
community makes it.  If one disagrees on the direction of a project, he or she
should join and lead the change for the better.</p>
