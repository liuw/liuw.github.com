</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Never thought I would paint myself into a corner like this.</p>
<p>I work on open source project for a living. I like the idea that my
code is generally useful. I care how my code is being used to a
degree, but I'm definitely not a strong supporter of one particular
franchise of open source camp. Instead, I carefully avoid arguments
about different ideologies and / or definitions about open source /
free software. Those are difficult questions. Though they are very
important, I would rather spend my time somewhere else on more
productive stuff.</p>
<p>My strategy has served me well. I sometimes read the license of the
projects I contribute to. But all in all, I don't care that much. I
believe most people are just like me, they want to do cool
stuff. What's inside the license file isn't at all the critical to
making a contribution. And to clarify my position, software, open
source or not, it is a mean (however critical it is) to move forward
human civilization, not an end in itself.</p>
<p>Things changed recently. I got involved with BSD family more
often. That causes quite a bit of headache for me. Everyone knows a
good software engineer should reuse as much code as possible. So when
I try to contribute to BSD, I always think to import some code I write
for Linux. But first and foremost, we need to get the license
straight. Unfortunately there is quite a bit of ambiguity in the
licensing of the code I want to pull in.</p>
<p>So I discussed with team members about potential issues, spent almost
half an hour with a colleague figuring out what the actual license of
some modules should be, and ventured to write several one-liner
patches to fix them to reflect reality.</p>
<p>And that, of course, didn't end well. Everyone knew the current
situation is not ideal, but as every other discussions regarding
license, it quickly got derailed into several directions: discussion
whether one particular license exists or not, suggestion that I should
leave it as-is, suggestion I should copy all rights holders (for the
record I didn't agree because I was merely fixing bugs).  I drafted
one reply or two, but in the end I deleted them because I just didn't
think that's going to be productive in any way.</p>
<p>The cost of any license related patch is too high. Not that writing
a one-liner patch is particularly hard labor. It is the ensuing
endless discussion that makes it so tiresome. No wonder everybody
seems to avoid such topic as hard as they can.</p>
<p>All in all, I think I made a stupid mistake to even dare writing such
patches. There are a lot of more interesting and pressing problems to
be solved. That's where I should divert my energy to.</p>
<p>Happy hacking, not happy arguing.</p>                </article>

outsider. It's used to patch kernel raw machine code during
runtime. Why is it useful? It gives you a chance to selectively patch
machine code according to CPU features and vendors.</p>
