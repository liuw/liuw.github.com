</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I'm now setting a new resolution: I plan to write one blog post per
week.</p>
<p>I was sitting at the desktop watching random videos on the Internet
this morning, then all of a sudden I felt hollow. I realized I would
have wasted quite a lot of time just watching random videos on the
Internet. Life is too short to do things like that.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I do have a lot of things that I want to write
about. I accumulate topics quite fast because I read articles and
books daily, so I don't think I will run out of ideas to rant about.</p>
<p>I have accumulated several drafts in my home directory but never got
the motive to finish them. They sort of sit there rotting away until I
eventually don't have the appetite to look at them anymore and delete
them. This is quite bad.</p>
<p>The rule is simple: topic and length don't matter, just write one
post a week. Rhetoric can be bad, grammar errors are allowed -- heck,
I'm not aiming to become a professional writer or anything.</p>
<p>Let's see how it goes.</p>                </article>
