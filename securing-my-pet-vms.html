			<h1>Securing My Pet VMs</h1>
			<p>I have a number of (0 to 3, depending on conditions) pet VMs running
somewhere in the "cloud".</p>
<p>I don't want to become a 24x7 system administrator myself. I have far
more important things to do in my day to day life. On the other hand,
I have valuable data out there in those VMs, my secured communication
sometimes depends on them, so I do have incentive to make them as
secured as possible. Internet is a very dangerous place after all.</p>
<p>Putting myself in the shoe of a malicious actor, I won't have the mood
to penetrate a random server on the Internet with my own human time if
that target is not highly valuable. The attackers are likely to use
some well-known exploits to mass-scan to maximise gain over a set
period of time. With that in mind, most if not all attacks I'm facing
are from script-kiddies. Securing my VMs from attackers on the
Internet is simple -- I just need to follow every security
announcement channel of the software I use (from operating system to
applications) and at the same time apply security best practices. That
should save my arse under most situations.</p>
<p>An attack vector in the cloud era is the "cloud" itself. There will
always be security bugs in hypervisors. It's better to just assume the
underlying platform unsecured. This imposes quite a challenge. One can
easily turn into fully paranoid mode considering what the underlying
platform is able to do to his or her VMs. There isn't really not much
I can do. But again, my basic assumption is that my data isn't too
valuable to an attackers, so off-the-shelf encryption is good enough
for me. In fact, I do full disk encryption in my VMs most of the time,
so that no-one can peek into my disk image when it's offline. I also
stay away from the pre-baked images from the providers, so that I'm
immune to mis-configuration in their scripts or bug in the image.</p>
<p>I don't really consider having an IDS like Tripwire or AIDE running. It would
be relatively easy to observe abnormal traffic to determine if my box is
compromised. IDS doesn't provide much value in the threats <em>I</em> face.
Furthermore, by the time IDS or any other mechanism discovers an intrusion has
happened the highest priority is to migrate all data to a safe place. Figuring
out what bugs lead to the intrusion is irrelevant in that context. It would be
nice though if there is tool that is integrated with Linux distribution.
FreeBSD has `freebsd-update IDS', which is convenient and useful to a degree. I
haven't found similar utility in the Linux distribution I use and it's not
likely to happen in the future because fundamentally Linux distribution is not
developed as an entity but built with a bunch of loosely coupled software.</p>
<p>End of brain dump when I'm building a storage VM.</p>
