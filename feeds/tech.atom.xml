&lt;a href="http://www.xenproject.org"&gt;Xen Project&lt;/a&gt; for two years, and I also
help develop &lt;a href="http://github.com/pythoncn/june"&gt;June&lt;/a&gt; in my spare
time. What I've learned so far is that running a (proper) open source
project is never an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open Source&lt;/em&gt; means different thing to different people. To many
people who's new to this concept, probably it just means "putting your
source code in the public so that it can be useful to others".  This
is of course a valid definition, but it's only the first stage of an
open source project. If you want your project to thrive, to have
bigger impact there's much more to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, a proper open source project should have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;publicly avaiable source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proper open source license&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proper document to certain degree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public channel for discussion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;well-defined development process and responsive maintainers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I don't think Github does a great job in providing public
channel for discussion, it does provide a viable solution for #4. It
lowers the barrier to get involved in open source project. Mailing
list is also popular amongst old-school hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the rest pretty much depends on project owner / initiator. #1
should be very easy to achieve. #2 and #3 are often overlooked,
however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having a license is very likely to turn away potential
contributors, because contributors have the right to know how their
code is going to be used and avoid potential legal problems. It might
be hard to choose one license from all those popular ones, but it's
definitely something you need to decide at the very first beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a bit tricky to define "proper document to certain degree". I
personally believe that the minimum degree of documentation should be
able to help a fresh user / developer start using / developing the
software without any major problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last item requires most time and effort. Many people develop open
source software to get a paycheck, but more develop for fun and
non-profit purpose. Wearing my latter hat as a developer for June, I
often feel I don't have enough time to look at all the missing
features and answer all the quesions. There's really no silver bullet,
all we can do is to devote more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mention in the beginning, I develop open source software for both
profit and fun.  How good (bad) did we (the two teams) do? The
following paragraphs are by no means claiming I made any significant
contribution on the whole process. They are just my views and my views
only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Xen Project is doing well in general. We've got a team of
people who understand the development of open source projects. We try
hard to work with upstream / downstream projects. All development
activities happens in the public mailing list and process is
well-defined. We hold regular Xen Docsday to update documents,
etc. During the last year we've seen some siginifant improvement on
the whole development process, especially after joining the Linux
Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for June, it's not that good. I got involved in June one and a half
years ago. June has always been an open source project since its
genesis. What fell short is the last but most important item -- the
process is not very well-defined and code not very well
maintained. I'm not blaming anyone because noone gets benefit out of
it by developing June, but how can we fix / improve things? Adding new
features is important, however it's just impossible to develop all the
features by my own. And in my opinion only by building an eco-system
(however small) can we make a project healthy and prosper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to June, the core idea is that now we need to build a
minimum viable product for both end users and developers. I've tried
to identify some key steps to bootstrap and attract developers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improve documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;develop necessary features, better test coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;request for contribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to spend some time on rewriting several documents and define
a clearer development process. As for feature parity there's still
lots of work to do. There're still lots of missing features on the
TODO list. Unfortunately up to this point the core team is really on
their own, requesting external contribution might be too early at this
stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently working on #2 on that list, though I cannot say for sure
how much time I can put into it. At least I've got a plan and will try
to stick to it. Let's see how it plays out.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Fix Debian Wheezy's Openswan Regression with Apple Devices</title><link href="http://blog.liuw.name/fix-debian-wheezys-openswan-regression-with-apple-devices.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-05-04T23:40:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Wei Liu</name></author><id>tag:blog.liuw.name,2014-05-04:fix-debian-wheezys-openswan-regression-with-apple-devices.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In late March Debian Security team pushed a security update to Openswan package in Wheezy. My Macbook Air cannot connect to Openswan anymore after upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched a bit and found out that somebody already filed a bug report on Debian bug tracker: &lt;a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=744717"&gt; bug 744717 &lt;/a&gt;. There's also a report on Openswan's Github page to confirm this bug: &lt;a href="https://github.com/xelerance/Openswan/issues/78"&gt;issue 78&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Debian bug tracker a user named Liu DongMiao provided a patch and it was reported to work. I had a look at that patch but didn't quite like it, because it leaked a macro in C file, which is not a proper fix to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root cause of the problem is confilict in header file. Debian Security team removed ISAKMP_NEXT_NATD_BADDRAFTS. Then they had to comment out or remove some code to handle that flag, of which Apple devices make use. Unfortunately I cannot get Apple to fix their code so I have to fix mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix is simplier than I thought. I compared upstream Openswan 2.6.37 with Wheezy's patched version, then restored the original flag and those code snippets. I was worried that the overriden new flag was used in code but it wasn't. I didn't touch changelog or version number of that package, so that when a new package is out it can be automatically updated when the maintainers push a new package to fix that bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my &lt;a href="../files/fix-osx-baddraft-flag.patch"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; attached. If you want to know how to rebuild Debian package, &lt;a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/index.en.html"&gt;Debian New Maintainers' Guide&lt;/a&gt; is a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
