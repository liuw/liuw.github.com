			<h1>Rant: Pissed off by Politics</h1>
			<p>Many Linux distributions function on the basis that people around the
world subscribe to its ideology. In such model nobody can impose
anything on anybody else. On a large scale this model works well
enough to keep several major distributions function properly and
produce high quality software. But on a smaller scale, things can go
wrong.</p>
<p>I have been user of one Linux distribution D for many years. I like
way it is organised. I'm quite satisfied with the quality of the
distribution overall.</p>
<p>Then there is one program I use almost daily. For the first time I
used it, I found out the version in D was quite old comparing to
upstream version. I sent an email to ask the package maintainer if I
can help upgrade the package to the latest version. But it turned out
the package maintainer was aware of that but he wouldn't want to
upgrade to the latest version because he and the upstream maintainer
held different ideas of how things should be done.</p>
<p>Over the course of 6 years, things didn't get improved. I wasn't
alone. Many people offered helping hands, but all the effort was
blocked due the the same reason. And to be honest, to this day nobody
really understands what is the real reason that blocks this whole
thing -- it dates back to 16 years ago according to my own
archaeology, and there isn't any public record. The only information
people get is that they had discussions and several proposals many
years ago.</p>
<p>The higher level reason is that it "doesn't meets the normal distro
expectations and standards". In order to not make myself a fool and
take the wrong side, I check how things are done in other popular
distributions like G, A and F. It seems that they do have the relative
new version and aren't concerned with the blocker mentioned in D's
package.</p>
<p>At this point I feel frustrated and pissed. On one hand I respect the
package maintainer because he obviously put huge amount of effort into
this package - he went as far as writing a huge patch to did things
the way he saw fit and maintained that patch for years; on the other
hand it looks like he is holding hostage of everybody using D to make
his proposal accepted upstream.</p>
<p>Politics is inevitable in life. But I don't want to see a
volunteer-based open source project turned into an arena for people
who push for their private agendas while actively harming the interest
of wider community.</p>
<p>I would either package my own version or write to D mailing list to
take over the project. As of today I've finished a preliminary version
of the new package, with all the cruft removed. I also filed a new bug
report to urge the package maintainer to reconsider upgrading to the
latest upstream version.  I don't like to aggressively take over
things, but for the benefit of larger community, I will do what needs
to be done.</p>
