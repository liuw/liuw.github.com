			<h1>Dabbling in Data Structures and Algorithms Once Again</h1>
			<p>Strange it may seem, I don't think I ever dealt with coding interviews
well. Not that I've never been to one, it is just that I didn't realy
get my job offers by solving puzzles and writing linked list, tree or
graph algorithms.</p>
<p>When I was in school, I dealt with low level stuff. As system
administrator I mostly wrote scripts. I just needed to understand how
a system worked. I worked on various kernels, but most data structures
and algorithms weren't rocket science there. I studied algorithms
using some of the prestigious books in the field. But I never used
them in real life. I thought data structures and algorithms were fun
and boring at the same time. It was fun because it was like solving
puzzles, boring because I had no use of it. In the end I didn't spend
much time on that subject.</p>
<p>Then came the job hunting season. It's quite pervasive to ask
algorithm related questions in interviews. I think I did badly in most
of them. But I used my other skills to get some job offers. I
considered myself lucky.</p>
<p>Nowadays I ponder from time to time what it would be like to dabble in
data structures and algorithms again -- what if I want to change job
at some point? Better keep myself sharp and be ready all the time.  So
I registered an account on one of the online judge services and picked
an easy question.</p>
<p>The first thing I had to do was to convince myself to leave all the
error handling logic alone. I stopped asking questions like "what if
the memory allocation fails" and "how can I sanitise the input" and
blundered on.</p>
<p>The second thing that baffled me was the environment. I was presented
with a web based editor. My muscle memory worked against me. Every
time I tried to use Emacs keybindings the editor did something I
didn't expect. My thought was constantly interrupted. I guess I could
have used my own development environment to make things easier.</p>
<p>Then I sadly discovered that I basically forgot all the relevant bits
on the subject. Due to time constraint, I tried to invent a caching
algorithm for the problem, but only to find it harder and harder to
debug.</p>
<p>At that point I was quite frustrated. The problem was marked as
"easy". I was either too stupid to even solve an easy problem or
missed something very obvious.</p>
<p>It turned out I did miss something. There was an O(n) algorithm for
the problem with only a few lines of code. I blinded myself with my
horribly obscured algorithm -- though it was quite close to the
correct one. I had the "aha" moment when I looked at how other people
solved it and wondered why I missed that.</p>
<p>So my first coming back to the subject was not working well. That is
more or less expected. People get rusty over time. And in my defense I
am not used to interview style coding at all. The next step is to pick
up books and tune myself to get used to the restricted
environment. Hopefully I can reacquaint myself with this subject and
make it useful at some point.</p>
